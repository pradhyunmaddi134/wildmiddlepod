        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> All right, come as you are. This is The Wild Middle. I'm Pradhyun and today I'm here with a longtime friend, William. So basically, yeah, we've been childhood friends and though our friendship has been sort of paused because I've moved to India, we still have kept contact through online friendships and Minecraft. So, you know, we're just, we've stayed together over the years regularly. Yeah. So, we're talking today about how we can form effortless friendships—firstly how they start and why they last. And also reflecting on William's first year at Ohio State, from applications to adjusting on campus. So yeah, thank you so much for being here, William.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah, for sure.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Yeah. I guess like, it's pretty hard to describe our connection really. I think it's like one of us will remember that the other one exists and like, you know, we'll just call each other up. Like people will be like, "Hey, do you want, hey, you want to play Minecraft?" And then the other one will be like, "Oh, sure." So like, yeah. Can you describe what that's like for you? Like how do you feel the sense of connection?

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> I guess it's nice that we live in 2025 and we have the internet because, like Pradhyun said, he and I were really close friends back when we were little. And so now with the internet we can still connect with each other. So it's just like it was before except over the internet, which is worse, but at least it's still there. Right? At least we're not like, we just like, at least we still like talk to each other and I think that's a great thing.

        <span class="time-marker">[2:15] How our friendship started in social groups</span>

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Yeah. We met in like social groups, like, yeah. I don't know. It was like so weird because I think the social group was like, it was technically an intervention for neurodiversity, but it didn't seem that way. It just seemed like something fun that we go to.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah, like it's literally a group for socializing, so like we were meant to make friends with each other.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Right. Yeah. It was interesting that we had our friendship develop in like such controlled conditions and like, you know, it still resisted.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah. It was just like a group of like kids who were neurodiverse in a variety of different ways. And then they, we just kind of made friends with each other, I guess.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Yeah, yeah. I think even like the shared activities, like I think the shared activities that we did to like, you know, like I'm sure you remember things like just me and stuff like that.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah, I do remember that. Like is this like a thinking of you moment or just you moment, right?

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what like, yeah, like. Yeah, I feel like, like even if you don't have those I think we'd want to connect regardless. I think there's something about us too that, you know, just have that, just made it possible, I think.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah. And like it just shows that neuroautistic people are not heartless. We do have the same need for connection as other people and like, you know, what we learned is like, you know, supplement to that, but there's still that internal capacity is what a lot of people I think need to know.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Yeah, for sure.

        <span class="time-marker">[4:30] Defining neurodiversity personally</span>

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> So yeah, about neurodiversity, which is the main topic of this podcast. So yeah, how do you define neurodiversity personally?

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Well, I think neurodiversity is just the state of us living in a world where not everyone is neurotypical. Some of us have certain conditions like autism. I personally have autism, and there's other ones like ADHD. But I think it's important that in order for there to be neurodiversity, there has to be neurotypical people in the first place.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> And that's an interesting question actually because there's some recent studies lately that say that like 50% of Generation Z is identifying as neurodiverse. It's not very clear whether those are all diagnosed, officially diagnosed or whether they're speculating on their own or whatever, but it's still very interesting, right, that like, and I think it's kind of true because in our generation it's often noted that we have more awkward mannerisms perhaps from our growing up on the internet. It's like, you know, the Gen Z stare, right? Where like someone older tries to make small talk and we're just like...

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Well, I don't really know if the increase in neurodiversity is being caused by the internet. I think a big part of it is just like we're diagnosing more people, which I think is a great thing because once you diagnose more people, that's great.

        <span class="time-marker">[7:45] Gen Z, the internet, and attention spans</span>

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think a lot of it can be put down to potentially internet-related phenomenon because like, I think a lot of people started to notice that they had these conditions after the lockdown, which to be granted, can be also because they're more internally oriented and they have more time to focus on themselves in the lockdown. But it's also, I think it's because they've been glued to their screen so long and so then they have difficulty coming back out. So yeah, it's like you can get a sense of being neurodiverse from that, you know, which doesn't make those struggles any less real. It's just a possibility to consider.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> That reminds me of a YouTube video I once saw that was basically making the argument that YouTube shorts and like other types of short-form content is quite literally making everyone have ADHD. Like what it was basically saying was that the more people watch short-form content, the less able they are to like log back into long-form content. Like if you wanted to write a long essay or watch a long documentary for example, you just simply would not be able to because your brain is more wired to short-form content. It's just easier on your brain. And so I think it creates more of the inattentive symptoms. Not sure about the hyperactive part, but yeah.

        <span class="time-marker">[11:20] Spotting neurodiversity – special talents and hyperfixations</span>

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> So yeah, how do you think you can spot neurodiversity in your life and in the lives of others, diagnosed or undiagnosed? How do you think it shows up?

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Well, my personal experience is that I feel like a lot of people with, well, I can only really comment on autism because that's what I have, but a lot of people with autism I know have like special talents. For me, I have this really weird talent where I can sing like 40 different national anthems just by heart.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Yeah, I want you to do that. I want you to do that sometime. I don't know when, but you are going to do it.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Okay. You want me to do it?

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Yeah. I mean, like at the right time. Okay. Yeah. I'll call upon your talents.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Okay. My old flight coach, like flying planes, who was also autistic, he told me that he's been playing Clash Royale ever since middle school and he has every single card on Clash Royale just like maxed out, which, you know, obviously sounds kind of like a stupid thing to do, but like the truth is it takes a lot of like time and effort to max out every card. I don't know if I would do it or like if he should be doing it, but like the fact that he could do it, that to me is a special talent. You know what I'm saying?

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Yeah. Yeah. I think it's like, yeah, a lot of times it's like the difference between an autistic person being perceived as like the next great genius or just some crack buffoon on the internet. The only difference is like where they apply their interest. It's the same level of dedication, but like, if it goes to chemistry, it's great. If it goes to, I don't know, Smash Brothers, it's bad or something.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Like, well, it's not necessarily bad. Like I wouldn't say being really good at Smash Bros is like totally useless. I mean, well, like you're, if you're like that good at it. Considering my circumstances though, I'm probably never going to compete competitively or like really do anything in that sphere. So like, it's like, why are you doing this?

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Okay. Yeah, that's fair. It's like, yeah, it's like whatever, bro. Not everything needs to have a reason, so yeah.

        <span class="time-marker">[15:40] Strengths of neurodiverse people & family challenges</span>

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> How do you, what do you think are the strengths of neurodiverse people and like how do you cope with some of the challenges?

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Well, like I said, like neurodiverse people have special talents. You were kind of talking about how like we have like the same amount of focus, but it's like sometimes, you know, like more directed to one thing. Right? I think that's like a strength and at least in my personal opinion, having that strength more than makes up for the struggles. Me personally, my biggest struggle when I grew up was my relationship with my dad. I kind of wasn't too good at communicating with him, and so we kind of like got into fights a lot.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Oh, okay. I see. Because yeah, parent-child relationship can be a struggle.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah. Yeah. And I think a big part of it was my parents were both immigrants from China and like, you know, in China and like Asia in general, like they don't really have like that great of an idea of like what autism is.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Yeah. Yeah. I think in my family that was also a component. Yeah, it was pretty shocking for both my mom. I have a cousin who's also autistic, which by the way, you can watch his interview too on this channel. So like, yeah, he, I think it's like, for her, for my cousin at least, and his family is a little bit more, it was a little bit more manageable since like, there's already one autistic person in the family. But like with my mom, it was like the first, it was the very first thing. You know, it was like the first introduction to a whole new world of like therapies and neurodiversity and a different understanding of strengths than what she had been indoctrinated to. So like, it was like there's a whole new chapter in her life. So yeah, it was quite difficult to adapt to. Do you think your parents could relate to that?

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah, I think so.

        <span class="time-marker">[20:05] Maintaining friendships online vs. face-to-face</span>

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> All right. Yeah, that's interesting. So yeah, how do you think, well, yeah, you obviously have a great friendship with me. But yeah, how do you think you've maintained other friendships in general? Like do you still have childhood friends that you can talk to a lot? Like how do you, is it like, you can maintain a connection without necessarily having to talk to them? Are you proactive about it? Are you reactive about it? How does it work for you?

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> I think the person who I would call my best friend is this guy who I went to like elementary and middle school with, but then he moved to Texas at the end of middle school. And then, so he went to a different high school than me, obviously. But pretty much throughout high school we just like, you know, called occasionally and played video games together and very similar to like what you were describing at the beginning. Like we took advantage of the internet to remain friends with each other.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> And that's interesting. I think like the main problem with the internet is that there are not as many nonverbal indicators and like, you can't, it's not as embodied physical, so it can seem lesser, but I think in some ways it's actually better for autistic people to have online interactions. Like I've had a lot of friendships where I've maintained them through online connections, and I've even had friendships where I've started them entirely online. So like, yeah, it's like easier...

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> The wrong, you were talking about... wait.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Yeah, I was talking about online friendships and like, you know, how I maintain. Yeah. So yeah, I'm thinking that medium is like actually even more suitable because you don't have to pay attention to all these nuances. I feel like we're usually like pretty straightforward people in terms of what we mean, what we say, like what we say is pretty much what we mean. So you don't need to have all these complicated barriers and all that. So yeah, on.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah, I agree with that. But at the same time, I still personally prefer face-to-face interactions just because they feel a bit more human.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Oh yeah. That's fair. That's fair. Yeah. I'm, I agree with like everything you said about like, not having to pick up social cues and stuff, but I kind of just feel like the benefit of face-to-face interactions outweighs the benefit of online interactions.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's fair. This is my personal opinion though. Yeah, that's fair. I think no one form of interaction should be exclusive or even valued over the other. I think it just depends on what your life is flowing to at the very moment. I, for example, don't really think anyone in my high school is really that cool, so...

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Ah, got you.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Yeah. So like, yeah, I can, I'm more into online connections, so yeah. Just depends on, yeah, and I also definitely think that people's personalities can change as well. Like for me personally, for example, one day I might really want to like go out and make a whole bunch of new friends and another day I'd just be content sitting at home and doing homework and doing some of my hobbies that don't involve other people, you know?

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Oh, yeah. I think there's a newness aspect to each connection too. I think it's like, I've noticed actually that like I talk to friends that I've made more recently a lot more than friends that I've been, that have existed for a long time. I talk to them more frequently. I think it's because the newness of each person's more interesting. So like I talk to them more, whereas with the other person it's like, oh, I already know this is pretty much secure. There's not much new to explore. I mean, it's nice to have it and I wouldn't necessarily abandon people, but like, you know, it's not...

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah, I agree with that actually.

        <span class="time-marker">[24:30] Autism and social misunderstandings in elementary school</span>

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Yeah. Interesting. So, yeah. Do you have any, were there any challenges associated with autism in your friendships? Like face to face or online? Like where you didn't quite grasp what the other person was trying to communicate, where they didn't quite get you, anything like that?

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> I remember back in elementary school, because no one really understood me, I guess, I had like certain habits that kind of made me seem like a bad kid. Like the stereotypical bad kid who likes to cause problems for teachers and annoy their...

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> I think you were some Diary of the Wimpy Kid. Like wait, say that again. Fregley Diary.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Oh, right. Yeah. Well I don't think Fregley was like a bad kid though. I think he was just weird like me. I was like a bad kid.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Oh yeah. What'd you do?

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah. Nothing that I felt like was deliberately bad. I feel like a lot of the times... I do remember this one incident where this was like the first recess, right? We were all lined up to go back to class and then I had my eyes closed and for whatever reason I did not really feel like opening them. Like, you know, I was just... So I decided that I was going to go back to class with my eyes closed. And in order to accomplish this, I held out my hand and felt for the person in front of me.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Oh.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> And my intention, okay, and my intention was to use the touch to detect where I was in relation with the rest of the line and get back to class that way. Number one, I didn't see where I was putting my hand. It turned out to be the person's butt and the other person was a female, so it didn't make things any better. And number two, what I didn't realize is that a lot of kids just didn't like being touched in the first place like that. That was just something that never occurred to me. Like maybe this kid would not feel good. And so because that didn't occur to me, I didn't think there'd be any problems if I decided I wanted to do this challenge. Right? And so that obviously earned me a trip to the principal's office, you know?

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Exactly. Oh yeah. That's such a pretty story. Yeah. I can honestly relate to the eyes closed thing. I like walking around with my eyes closed, but like I've never really tried to get to a classroom. That's so interesting. So yeah, I'm more curious about how it manifests in more of an intimate context though. Like if you already know someone and if you did something to cause a mismatch in expectations in their relationship, something like that.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Honestly, I feel like all the people who were friends with me went out of their way to be nice to me. And I don't know if even back then they detected that something was wrong with me even before I did. But I do feel like I made a lot of friends because they went out of their way to be nice to me. One example I can think of is I had a friend back in, I believe this was like first, second grade. I don't know. But she decided that she was going to try to quote, make me good. And so what she did was she came up with this whole program where if I went through X amount of days without being bad, she would reward me with stuff from her house. I guess I remember she gave me...

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Was she like the same age as you or like an older kid?

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah, she was the same age as me. She was like the kid who sat next to me in computer lab.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Oh, crazy.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> And I kind of liked the concept that, back then, like I thought that, you know, maybe like other kids seemed to be good. Maybe it's like a skill I can learn, right? Like, I obviously, I didn't really want to be like the bad kid, so I thought that this would be like a good thing, right? Looking back, it's kind of interesting to me that like I said, I wasn't doing anything deliberately wrong. I wasn't really a bad kid, I just seemed like it. Right? And so looking back, it was interesting to me how I just kind of took it like, yep, I'm a bad kid. Like hopefully I can make that go away if I do these things that this girl is telling me to do, you know?

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Oh yeah. That's pretty interesting. Yeah. I don't know, I don't really like that kind of relationship. I don't know. She's, I guess it worked out for you, but it's still so weird to me.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Honestly, I don't really know if it made that big of a difference. Like I feel like the moment she kind of gave up, I just kind of went back to being normal myself. And honestly, like I still have certain habits. It's just that now that I'm older, people don't think I'm a bad kid anymore. They just think I'm weird.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> No, no. They might dismount to the same thing. Oh yeah.

One of my hyperfixations was My Little Pony because my sister was watching it, and I just love reading those phrases, so yeah. Okay. So yeah, I guess now it's time to talk about your college arc.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> How's it like being there? In California you're stuck in LA.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Oh, yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. Like, yeah. How do you describe it being here in Ohio? Is it like the culmination of a long journey? Do you feel like you're just being there without much of a purpose? How does it feel to you?

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Well, I wouldn't say I'm there without much of a purpose. I have a purpose. I just feel like I don't really know what it is. I'm still trying to find it, you know? I feel like I have a lot of different hobbies that I'm interested in. And so far I've joined the flight team and I've hopefully been pretty dedicated. They let me onto the team, so I guess I have been dedicated, so yeah. One of the coaches is also autistic, which is pretty cool. He told me that being autistic helps you with most of the events.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Oh, interesting. So, yeah. So yeah. You feel like you have more of a community there than ever.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Well, I like flying, so definitely.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Nice, nice. Yeah. That's interesting. I think like, sorry, what were you saying? One thing we noticed, like with my mom for example, you don't know, but like, she actually wanted me to talk about a lot of stuff with you. Like, I never really did that much, honestly. I think we just played Minecraft and that was good enough for us. Like we were just enjoying presence. So like, yeah. I think it might be also a bit of a generational thing too, but I think for autistic people, they're more content doing activities rather than really trying to get to know the person. Like, I'm also pretty conversational myself personally. But it's not really in, I'm in impersonal conversation where we're talking about some subject rather than really getting to know the person and getting really to know the person. 'Cause I feel sort of awkward in that instance.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> I feel like I enjoy small talk. I'm just not that good at it. Like, if I were better at it, I'd make small talk with everybody, you know?

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Yeah. Yeah. I enjoy small talk for the, for like, yeah, I just like initiating things, so I'll often be the one to be asking those sort of questions and like, yeah, I like small talk because it has the potential to develop into something more interesting.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah, for sure.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> So yeah. Yeah. So yeah. What would, how would you describe your college journey? Like how did you prepare for colleges in high school?

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> I feel like I've always just been like an Ohio State vibes type of person, you know? But I can, back in junior year, one of my friends who was two years younger than me asked me, where are you going to go to college? And I said, well, obviously I don't know yet. Right? And then I can give you a guess, right? And she said, okay. I said, I'm probably going to go to Ohio State. Just like realistically, right? I don't really want to go to anywhere else. Like, I feel like the UCs are for Asians. The Ivy Leagues are for nerds and like, I mean like Ohio State, it doesn't really matter what other people are there. It's like, as long as you fit what the university is offering. Right?

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Yeah.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> And you know, Ohio State is just like a giant school. Like I feel like no matter who you are, there's something for you there. There's something you can relate to about Ohio State.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Fair. So like, it's like, you still wanted like a comfortable place to be at.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. I think a lot of people just try way too hard with college applications, so it's good that you're good, that you have an idea of what you want to go for without like...

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Well, to be fair, I applied to more prestigious schools as well. I just didn't really want to go to them.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> It's funny, when I was picking my college, like when I was making the final decision, it was between this school and Reed College. I don't know if you know Reed College, just like, it's like a tiny school, like 1400 kids and it's like a liberal arts college, so like it's obviously liberal.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah. It's not suited to what you want to do as a pilot. Right. It makes sense.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Well, I, realistically, I just wanted to go there so I could have harder classes, but then like in the end, Ohio State just called to me more, I guess. Plus it's a school my dad went to. So like that added to it a lot actually.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Oh, okay. That's interesting. Yeah. So yeah, how do you think your university figured into this whole process of picking a university, and, you know, basically just adapting yourself to fit this, like, you know, how do you think it affected that? Because this is actually like the topic of the podcast. Really the wild middle is all about this period of transition from being an adolescent to an adult. Like, I just want to know how you feel about certain aspects of transition. Like stuff like having your own dorm, having to do your own practical tasks. I know you've done camping, so I think that might have figured into it. So like it cultivates...

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah, for sure.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Physical independence. So yeah, I just want to know how you feel about it in general. Like living in college in general.

        <span class="time-marker">[29:45] Living independently & camp counselor experience</span>

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> I honestly don't really have any problems with it. Like, I think, like you said, I've been camping. Specifically, I volunteered a lot as a camp counselor, and so not only was I responsible for myself, I was responsible for a whole group of kids, like in the wilderness as well. So I feel like that experience realistically just made it like fine.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Oh, okay. That's super interesting. Yeah. It's not only taking care of yourself, but also leadership. That's so interesting. Yeah. So like, yeah, I guess it was like a pretty straightforward journey for you, right? You thought, well, oh, I'll probably get into Ohio State and, yeah, I'm fine with that outcome. And you just sort of got into it.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah. Yeah. It was a pretty simple journey for you.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Well, from my, in my case, I'm still figuring it out because I'm a little bit younger than you. Ah, yeah. Yeah. I guess like the whole process of college applications and stuff is like very interesting and like hard for me. I don't know. It's kind of hard to focus and really decide on one thing. I don't think I have that same, like, I wouldn't want to go to a school that my parents went to just because they went to it. Because like, I don't, I don't think even my parents would want me to go to the same school as them. Like 'cause they went to Arizona State University and you know, oh, it has a bit of reputation.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Well, Arizona State University isn't bad, it's just like, I mean, it's not bad, but you know, it has a reputation as like the middle. Honestly, if I were to describe Arizona State, it's Ohio State with a lower ranking. That's about it.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Like, why would you want to go to that? It's like, aim high, I want to go somewhere interesting.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Oh, I see. Yeah. I just don't want to explore new things and, you know, do new stuff. So yeah, a lot of that same thing with my majors too.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Yeah. But for you, I guess like, yeah, I guess you can just pick like some engineering thing and just be a pilot and something like that. Right.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> I am double majoring in aerospace engineering and aviation because they told me that I couldn't fly out of the flight school unless I was an aviation major, so yeah.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Oh, interesting. Supposedly it's pretty busy. I feel like it's not too busy.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah. I feel like it's not too busy. And I kind of feel like that was how it was in high school too, like it just wasn't that hard for me.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. But do you think you were able to focus more?

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah, for sure. I kind of make this very clear in my college applications too. Like I don't see my autism as a weakness. I see it more of a strength because even though I've struggled with it, the benefit from being autistic, at least in my opinion, far outweighs the struggle.

        <span class="time-marker">[31:20] Message to neurodiverse people – autism as strength</span>

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Yeah. I think another term for autism, actually, it's interesting, 'cause I think the original term for autism came from a Greek word, which is like self-oriented or self-focused. Yeah. Which is very interesting to me. I think you can figure it in this way too, like increase independence from people and you just start doing your own thing. Yeah. I think that's a very positive example of how autism shows up.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah. And I think me being autistic made me more, like obviously I wasn't dedicated to everything, but the stuff that I did, I was very dedicated to it. An example going into ninth grade, I had no idea how to draw. And I was at an art magnet high school, right? And like a lot of, like 90% of my friends were artists to some degree. I wouldn't say not all of them are great artists, but like I'd say 90% of them were artists to some degree. And I looked at these people who could draw better than I could, like way better. And I said to myself, okay, why can't I draw? Like, it's kind of sad. I feel like I should change that. And so I just taught myself. I don't know how I did it, but now I can draw really, really well actually. Like I drew, at Ohio State, there's this lake called Mirror Lake. It's like in the middle of campus. And it's really pretty. And on the dorm whiteboard, on the door, I drew a picture of Mirror Lake and I was sitting on the couch listening to people outside and people were like, oh my God, is that Mirror Lake? Like they could tell what lake it was by my drawing skills and I, and I, yeah.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Interesting. You right? Yeah. Like so positive and yeah, I also tried drawing, but like, yeah, it was more for my own purposes 'cause I just wanted to draw whatever was in my imagination. I also had a friend who was doing it, which was kind of inspiring to me, but it was like I just wanted to be able to draw whatever was in my mind. And I didn't really get that far, but it was, you know, interesting or whatever. So, yeah. How would you describe your sense of community in general? Not like a generic community, but with neurodiverse people. Do you feel a sense of solidarity with them? Like if you see someone who has autism, do you have an inherent empathy and connection with them? How is it for you?

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah, I do actually. When people tell me that they have autism, that's generally something I don't forget. Like, even if you're the most boring person ever, and I'm bound to forget everything about you, if you tell me that you have autism, I'm not going to forget that. Like I just kind of can't.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Oh, yeah. Yeah. So based on that, do you have a specific sort of thing that you want to tell everyone who is neurodiverse or everyone who has autism? Like, is there something you want to tell them from your own experiences that you think can help them? Like, I want you to look through all of them and see what are the common patterns that you think they can learn from?

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> I think too many people see neurodiversity as a weakness. It's not a weakness, it's a strength in my opinion. And once you start seeing it that way, your whole worldview shifts and you just get better at everything, right? Like you really do. I think you have to see it as something that pushes you back a little bit, but then the benefits that you take away from it outweigh it by so much that, like me personally, if you gave me the option to restart my life without autism, I would choose not to do it. It's just been such a strength for me.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Oh, yeah, that makes sense. I think. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I think we've had vastly different journeys since I moved. But I think it's still so interesting to see how much we connect. There are so many common lessons, even though we've had different social environments, different levels of acceptance for autism. I think we still have the same sort of worldview, I think.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah. I definitely wouldn't trade my autism either.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Yeah. It feels like I would be trading out a part of myself because autism, I don't think it's a very well-defined condition. Right. Yeah. I think it's in everything you do potentially. So it would be like plugging myself out really, and replacing it with a new brain, right.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah.

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Okay. Well, there's only a little bit of time left, but so I guess this is pretty much, I guess like, yeah, I guess like reflecting and a concrete action for all autistic people is focus on yourself, focus on your talents. Don't worry about, don't worry about you being abnormal. And William, it's your time to shine. Go sing something right now.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah, I'll sing the Soviet National Anthem.

        <span class="speaker">[William sings]</span>

        <span class="speaker">Pradhyun:</span> Okay. Well, yeah, that's good enough. Yeah. Thank you so much, William. This has been so fun. Yeah, it's like I see you guys later. Bye. So my voice is kind of cooked, but like, yeah, sure. Yeah. Okay. Bye guys. See you later. Yeah. Bye William.

        <span class="speaker">William:</span> Yeah, bye.
